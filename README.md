# Kim-s-Uranium-Box-Model
Uses R to model Uranium 238 isotopes at the Permian Triassic boundary. Does so by using a looping systems of equations where the previous output is used to create the next. Creates 4 different models, each of which has a different change in parameter. Does not compare model output against known data
